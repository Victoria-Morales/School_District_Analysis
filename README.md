# School District Analysis

### Overview of Project
#### This project analyzes the standardized test data to provide insights into performance trends in relation to funding, school type, and school size.

### Purpose
#### By breaking down the data by school, grade level, school type, and spending, trends will emerge that will help leaders at the school district with future decision making. Because of concerns with the integrity of data for ninth grade level students at Thomas High School, we removed that data to evaluate what difference (if any) that made.

* How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
	* Replacing the ninth graders' math and reading scores does not change it's performance relative to the other schools, unless you are looking at ninth grade specific data.

* How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
	* Math and reading scores by grade - It only affects the ninth grade scores, Thomas High School no longer has scores to compare with (see images below).  
  * Scores by school spending - It is not affected.
	* Scores by school size - It is not affected.
	* Scores by school type - It is not affected.
